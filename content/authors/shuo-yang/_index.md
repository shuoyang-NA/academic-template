Shuo Yang is a postdoctoral fellow at Yanqi Lake Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Applications. His research interests include numerical analysis and scientific computation of PDEs. This mainly includes finite element methods, the analysis and design of numerical schemes for nonlinear constrained variational problem, and shape optimization. In general, he is interested in modeling, analysis and simulations of problems with background in materials sciences.
